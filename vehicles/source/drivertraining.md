### Hello HVAC!

Driving an ambulance is a whole skillset in itself and Hoboken is, in some ways, a great place to learn. If you want to pursue an EMS career it is an essential skill.

We are always training (and looking for) new drivers.

If you have any questions or need any help with this process, please don't hesitate to reach out to Sgt Rusko (Yuriy) or me (Michael Bubb). I have added some notes below to help

If you have a valid and non-probationary license and are interested, we need a photocopy of the license and a copy of your driving history abstract.

Information on the  NJ abstract is here (other states will have a similar process):

[*Driving History Abstract*](https://www.nj.gov/mvc/license/driverhist.htm)

Also if you are currently on a probationary license and need to upgrade it there is information here:

[*License Upgrade*](https://mymvc.state.nj.us/license-upgrade)

When cleared, we will let you know that you are ready for training.

We have a group of driver FTOs, the best way to get trained is to look for a trainer whom you know and/or who rides the same shifts. I recommend reaching out to someone you are comfortable with. If you are not sure who to ask feel free to reach out to the vehicles department.

Make sure the FTO fills out a feedback form (QR code is on the 2nd floor bulletin board) or this link:
