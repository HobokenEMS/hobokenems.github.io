## EVOC "Train the Trainer" dates

**Information**

  "This class will be virtual via Zoom.  Once you have registered for the date that works best for you.  We will send you some pre requisite paperwork that will need to be completed and returned to us and you will be assigned the 9 EVOC Units on our elearning platform.

  We record the time you spend in each unit as this is what you will be teaching.  We need show that you did spend the entire time in each unit.

  If you donâ€™t meet those times we will ask you to redo them.

  Once I have everything I will send you the webinar meeting link for the class.  The class will be about 2 hours long and is interactive."
